# Manual Rollout Control Commands:
# 1. Apply deployment: kubectl apply -f ramped-deployment.yaml
# 2. Monitor rollout: kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-ramped
# 3. Pause rollout after first few pods: kubectl rollout pause deployment/myapp-ramped
# 4. Check metrics/logs, then resume: kubectl rollout resume deployment/myapp-ramped
# 5. Pause again after next wave, verify, then resume
# 6. To rollback: kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp-ramped
#
# Progressive rollout schedule example:
# - Deploy 1 pod (10%) -> pause -> monitor 15 minutes
# - Resume -> 2 more pods (30%) -> pause -> monitor 30 minutes
# - Resume -> 3 more pods (60%) -> pause -> monitor 1 hour
# - Resume -> complete (100%)
