# Note: Shadow deployment requires a Service Mesh like Istio to mirror traffic
# Example Istio VirtualService for traffic mirroring:
#
# apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
# kind: VirtualService
# metadata:
#   name: myapp-mirror
# spec:
#   hosts:
#   - myapp-production-service
#   http:
#   - route:
#     - destination:
#         host: myapp-production-service
#       weight: 100
#     mirror:
#       host: myapp-shadow-service
#     mirrorPercentage:
#       value: 100.0  # Mirror 100% of traffic to shadow
#
# Monitor shadow deployment metrics and logs to validate behavior
# Shadow responses are discarded and never returned to users
